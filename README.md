This is a RESTful JWKS Server the provides public keys with unique identifiers for verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and implements key expiry.
It includes an authentication endpoint and handles issuance of JWTs with expired keys based on a query parameter.
This server can be tested against a test client as long as the server is RUNNING.
Provided are screenshots of the coverage of the server and also a screenshot of the test server grading.
To start running the server use the command "python server.py"
Method that I used to make it work was keeping the gradebot in the same directory tree and, while the server was running, used the command ".\gradebot.exe project-1 --run="python server.py".
